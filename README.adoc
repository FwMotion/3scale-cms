== Overview
The 3scale CMS tools project provides the ability to interact with 3scale's
Content Management System programmatically. The project also
demonstrates API-first code generation.

The included Command Line Interface (CLI) tool is a
rewritten and enhanced version of the same tool written in Ruby, available at
link:https://github.com/hguerrero/3scale-cms/tree/master[hguerrero/3scale-cms#master].
This  CLI tool has been re-implemented using Java and Quarkus.

[WARNING]
====
*The 3scale CMS tools, as well as the 3scale Content
Management API that they rely upon, are not supported by Red Hat. These tools
and the undocumented 3scale Content Management API may change at any moment
without any guarantee of backward compatibility. Therefore, these tools are
not recommended for production use.*
====

== Building Locally

Project builds are orchestrated by link:https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven],
utilizing link:https://maven.apache.org/wrapper[Maven Wrapper] with the goal for
a consistent compilation environment.

=== Prerequisites

The following is required to build 3scale-cms for any build type:

1. Java JDK 17 or newer
2. Maven 3.9.2 or newer - this is automatic when using link:https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/[Maven Wrapper]

To perform a native-mode build, at least one of the following must
also be installed:

1. link:https://podman.io[Podman]
2. link:https://www.docker.com[Docker]
3. link:https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel[Mandrel], a GraalVM downstream
   distribution that focuses solely on Quarkus support
4. link:https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM]

For more information on prerequisites and configuration for native-mode builds,
refer to the
link:https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image[Quarkus "Building a Native Executable" Guide].

=== Building in JVM-mode

To build 3scale-cms to run in JVM-mode, run the following Maven Wrapper phase:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw verify
----

Upon successful compilation, the 3scale-cms CLI may be executed via the
following Java command:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar cli/target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

=== Building in Native-mode

Similar to JVM-mode builds, native-mode builds are also run with Maven Wrapper.
The difference is by enabling the `native` profile:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw verify -Pnative
----

Upon successful completion, the 3scale-cms CLI may be executed via the newly
compiled executable:

[source,bash]
----
cli/target/3scale-cms-tools-cli-VERSION-runner
----

[NOTE]
====
Replace `VERSION` with the version number of 3scale-cms that was just compiled.
====

=== Running in Quarkus Dev-Mode

To run 3scale-cms CLI in Quarkus dev-mode, the following Maven Wrapper command
may be invoked from the project root:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -pl cli -am verify quarkus:dev
----


== Included Artifacts

This repository contains the following artifacts:

=== OpenAPI Specification for 3scale CMS

The 3scale CMS tools project provides documentation for the 3scale Content
Management API, which can be found in the repository at:
link:rest-client/src/main/resources/api-spec/3scale-cms.yaml[].

The documentation uses the *OpenAPI Specification v3.0* format. It describes
the available endpoints for managing CMS objects, along with the endpoint of
the Account Management API, which is used for lookup of the Developer Portal
base URL and the Developer Portal access code.

=== REST Client JAR

The 3scale CMS tools project provides a standalone REST client JAR. The JAR is
available in the GitHub Packages maven repository.

To use the JAR in a Maven project, first include the following repository
definition:

[source,xml]

== 3scale Content Management API Concepts

The 3scale Developer Portal consists of 3 primary types of objects:

=== Sections
A section is a logical grouping, somewhat similar to a directory.

=== Files
A file is a binary item, such as an image.

=== Templates
Templates refer to textual content that will be served from the 3scale CMS.
Templates may hold static content (such as scripts or stylesheets) or may be
templated for server-side rendering as needed.

== CLI Usage

=== Prerequisites

You must have an account in 3scale. The CMS contents can be viewed in the
**Developer Portal** section of the admin portal for that account.
To use the `3scale-cms` command you need to provide a few parameters:

- An **ACCESS_TOKEN**, which can be used instead of a PROVIDER_KEY. The access
token must be granted permissions to both the Account Management API and the
Content Management API.
- The **PROVIDER_KEY**, which can be found in the Account tab of your admin
portal (only visible to the users with "admin" role). The PROVIDER_KEY will be
ignored if an ACCESS_TOKEN is specified.
- The **PROVIDER_DOMAIN** of your admin portal. e.g.
`https://mycompany-admin.3scale.net`
- The **DIRECTORY**, which specifies a local directory path for determining
files to upload, download, or compare between the local filesystem and the
3scale CMS content. This is an optional parameter. If omitted, the `3scale-cms`
command will choose a working directory following the rules described in this
<<working_directory,note>>.

=== Workflow

==== Getting started
Create a directory where you will work on your CMS locally:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~
mkdir my_cms
cd my_cms
----

==== Create your `.cmsignore` file

[source,bash]
----
touch .cmsignore
----

You can edit this file at any time.

=== Command Details

The `3scale-cms` command has five actions:

- **info**      - show information about contents of the CMS and the local
files. It accepts the optional parameter: 'details'
- **diff**      - show the difference in contents between the CMS and the local
files. It accepts the optional parameter: 'details'
- **download**  - download all the contents of the CMS (no parameter). Or
specify a file or section (with its contents) to download
- **upload**    - upload all the local files (no parameter). Or specify a file
or section (with its contents) to upload
- **delete**    - delete all (that can be deleted) or a specific entry in the
remote CMS

[#working_directory]
[NOTE]
====
The `3scale-cms` command will determine the appropriate working directory based
on the following rules:

- If the root of the local CMS content is specified by the command line
parameter `-d` or `--directory`, then that directory is used.
- If the command line parameter is not specified but the environment variable
`THREESCALE_CMS_ROOT` is defined, then that directory is used.
- If neither are specified, then the current working directory is used.
====

==== 3scale-cms info
This command displays information about contents of the CMS and the local files.
It accepts the optional parameter: 'details'

[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm -it -v .:/cms:Z ghcr.io/fwmotion/3scale-cms PROVIDER_KEY PROVIDER_DOMAIN info
----

Output should resemble:
[source]
----
Contacting CMS at PROVIDER_DOMAIN/admin/api/cms to get content list
The layout 'main_layout' in file '/l_main_layout.html.liquid' was selected as the default layout for uploading new pages
118 items found in CMS
7 ignored local files (matching patterns in '.cmsignore')
152 (non-ignored) local files
8 implicit folders due to file/template system_names containing '/'
----

Use the following to get a list of specific files in each of these four
categories:

- CMS contents elements
- Locally ignored files
- Local files that are not being ignored
- List of folders created due to CMS elements with '/' in the name

[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm -it -v .:/cms:Z ghcr.io/fwmotion/3scale-cms PROVIDER_KEY PROVIDER_DOMAIN info details
----

==== 3scale-cms diff
This command displays the differences in contents (taking into account ignored
files and implicit folders) between the CMS and the local files.

Use

[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm -it -v .:/cms:Z ghcr.io/fwmotion/3scale-cms PROVIDER_KEY PROVIDER_DOMAIN diff
----

Output should resemble:

[source]
----
Contacting CMS at PROVIDER_DOMAIN/admin/api/cms to get content list
The layout 'main_layout' was selected as the default layout for uploading new pages

Summary:
0 files to be created locally
0 files to be updated locally
17 files to be created on CMS
1 files to be updated on CMS
----

To get the list of specific files to be applied on 'download' and 'upload' use:

[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm -it -v .:/cms:Z ghcr.io/fwmotion/3scale-cms PROVIDER_KEY PROVIDER_DOMAIN diff details
----

==== 3scale-cms download
If used without an additional file/directory name parameter, this command
downloads the entire contents of the CMS that either doesn't exist locally, or
is out of date locally (based on timestamps of files/folders).

If a filename is specified, then only that file is downloaded (if it exists in
the CMS and is out of date locally).

If a directory name is specified, then it and all its contents (recursively
down) are checked and any content that is found to exist in the CMS and is out
of date is downloaded.

[NOTE]
====
Existing files are overwritten on download, and missing files are ignored unless
the `--delete-missing` flag is specified.

Files matching patterns in `.cmsignore` are not currently skipped.
====

==== 3scale-cms upload
If used without an additional file/directory name parameter, this command
uploads all local files found under the current working directory that are
either out of date in the CMS (based on timestamps) or do not exist in the CMS.

If a filename is specified, then only that file is uploaded (if it exists in
the CMS and is out of date, or does not exist in the CMS).

If a directory name is specified, then it and all its contents (recursively
down) are checked and any content that is found to not exist in the CMS or is
out of date in the CMS is uploaded.

Files matching patterns in `.cmsignore` are skipped.

==== 3scale-cms delete
If used without an additional parameter this command will attempt to delete all
content under the `root` section on the remote CMS (indicated via domain
parameter).

If used with a specific filename it will attempt to delete that entry in the
remote CMS.

If used with a folder name, it will attempt to delete that section and all
sections and content under it in the CMS.

[WARNING]
====
*This action cannot be undone, and should be used with caution. Double-check
the domain parameter you intend to use.*
====

== Usage Notes

The `3scale-cms` command enables you to do offline editing, changes or
version control of the contents of a CMS in your admin portal in 3scale.

In the CMS it is possible to create a file, a template or a section. Examples
of files are an image, a JS script, or a CSS stylesheet. A template is generally
content in an `.html.liquid` file. A section is a hierarchical folder in the CMS
for storing other elements.

=== Mirroring CMS contents locally

The mirror used locally is a hierarchy of folders that mirrors the content
organization in the CMS. Thus _sections_ in the CMS are mirrored as directories
on your local file system, and the elements below that section in the CMS are
placed inside that directory.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to create a file/template in the CMS that is served from a path
other than its location in the CMS. e.g. a file called `image.jpg` that is in
the root section of the CMS, but is served from `other_path/image.jpg`. This
file will be mirrored locally into `./other_path/image.jpg`, with the directory
`other_path` being created to store it. However, this directory is tracked as
one of the _implicit folders_, to avoid a section for it being created by
mistake on any later upload.
====

=== CMS Ignore File

It is often desirable to have some files in the local directory that you do not
want to upload to the CMS. Examples could be files used in the version control
of your CMS contents (e.g. a `.git` folder), or files used in the testing or
Continuous Integration of your contents (e.g. `travis.yml` file).

To have the `3scale-cms` command ignore these files, they can be added to the
`.cmsignore` file in any directory of the CMS mirror. These files use the
'glob' format to allow specifying patterns of files and directories, not just
specific files.

=== New local page/layout files

When a local file of type `.html` or `.html.liquid` is created that does not
have the `\_` (underscore) prefix to indicate it is a partial or the `l_`
(l-underscore) prefix to indicate it is a layout, then the tool assumes that the
new file is a page and uploads it as such.

[NOTE]
====
By convention, partial filenames are expected to have the prefix `\_`
(underscore) and layout filenames are expected to have the prefix `l_`
(l-underscore). The `3scale-cms` tool does not enforce these conventions at
present. If partial or layout files are misnamed, they will have to be deleted
and recreated, as file renaming is not supported by 3scale.
====

=== Default layouts for new pages

When a page is created in the CMS, the layout to apply to it must be specified.
To allow for automatic use of the tool without user intervention the tool
chooses a default layout from the layouts in the CMS to use for new files it
creates.

Upon start-up the tool examines the list of layouts in the CMS and chooses one
as the default layout for new pages that will be created.

If no layouts are available in the CMS, the tool will not run.

If you wish to use a different layout for a newly created page, you currently
have to go to the CMS in the admin portal and change it manually.
