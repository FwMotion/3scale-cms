== 3scale Developer Portal API Concepts

The 3scale Developer Portal consists of 3 primary types of objects:

=== Sections
A section is a logical grouping, somewhat similar to a directory.

=== Files
A file is a binary item, such as an image.

=== Templates
Templates refer to textual content that will be served from the 3scale CMS.
Templates may hold static content (such as scripts or stylesheets) or may be
templated for server-side rendering as needed.
